# The TtR Citation Style

## WARNING: This is still in alpha! It may change at any time. For this reason, don't use it in production just yet.

> The TtR Citation Style is based on the tried-and-true [MLA8 citation style](https://pitt.libguides.com/citationhelp/mla8thedition), which is used by people all over the world, since it provides details for almost any scenario. However, I thought that it wasn't _quite_ tuned to my liking... which is why I made this.

> Important: If something is not listed here, expect it to be the same as it is in MLA8.
