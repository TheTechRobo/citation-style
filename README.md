# The TtR Citation Style

## WARNING: This is still in alpha! It may change at any time. For this reason, don't use it in production just yet.

> The TtR Citation Style is based on the tried-and-true [MLA8 citation style](https://pitt.libguides.com/citationhelp/mla8thedition), which is used by people all over the world, since it provides details for almost any scenario. However, I thought that it wasn't _quite_ tuned to my liking... which is why I made this.

> Important: If something is not listed here, expect it to be the same as it is in MLA8.

### The References Page
The page containing your references should be titled one of ("Works Cited", "References"). It should be the same font as you use for the rest of the document - we don't want to get fancy here.

### Definitions
#### Date
##### mm
mm should be a two-digit integer representing the month. For example, June would be 06.
##### Month
Month should be the month in plain English. For example, June would be June.
##### yyyy, Year
yyyy or Year should be the Year in 4 digits. For example, 2020.
##### dd, Day
dd or Day should be a two-digit integer representing the date. For example, 31.
##### Format
A date should be done in one of ("Day Month Year", "dd.mm.yyyy", "dd/mm/yyyy") formats, since they're the simplest ones. Examples are is 31 December 2020, 31.12.2020, and 31/12/2020.

#### Wayback Machine/archive.org notice
The Wayback Machine notice should be written as "Saved in the Wayback Machine" if the version you were looking at is there; "Saved in the Internet Archive" if it is in the Internet Archive; and not written at all if there is no copy in the Wayback Machine or Internet Archive.

### Citing sources
#### An interview you conducted
To cite an interview conducted by you, take this example text:

> LastName, FirstName 'Nickname if there is one' MiddleName. Personal interview. Date. Recording URL if applicable.

#### A webpage

##### A page on a website without an author
Take this example text:

> "Article Name." Website name, Company name (if not the same as website name), date modified, URL. Wayback Machine/archive.org notice.

##### A page on a website with an author

> LastName, FirstName 'Nickname' MiddleName. "Article Name." Website name, Company name (if not the same as website name), date modified, URL. Wayback Machine/archive.org notice.

##### Artwork

> FirstName 'Nickname if applicable' LastName. "Artwork Name". Year. Website name, URL. Wayback Machine/archive.org notice.

##### What to do if there isn't a date
First, view the source of the page and use the Find tool to look for "og:" - for search engines a date is in one of them. Otherwise, write (no date) or n.d.
